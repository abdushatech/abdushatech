            <h2 align="center">The Importance of Technology in Our Daily Life</h2>
            <h5> Technology, Jul 28, 2023</h5>
            <div  
            <p><b>Technology</b> is defined as a comprehensive process based on the application of science and knowledge in many areas of life in an orderly and thoughtful manner in order to achieve important and valuable purposes for individuals and communities.
      
          </br> How Has Technology Changed Our Lives?<br>
        </br>The advent of modern technology brought about great changes in our modern life. Before technology,  man did not know many modern means in his life but relied on simple primitive tools in everything. 
              Evidence of history tells us how Neanderthals used stones to burn fire to cook food and so on. Wood was used to make spears, which were used to hunt animals and other primitive methods. 
              Then, over the years, these techniques developed gradually until we reached the peak of technological advances in the present day. 
              Where technology knocked on the doors of people and broke into their homes without permission. So what are the most significant changes that technology has brought to our modern lives?<br><br><br>
              <div>
                <br>
               <span id="text">How Important Technology is in Our Daily Lives?<br><br>
              There is no doubt that we are experiencing tremendous development in technology. This technology has had a negative or positive impact on our life. As a result, it has influenced the way we live and we rely heavily on it. Humans continue to evolve continuously. 
              Technology will not stop at a single threshold, but we still hear daily discoveries and inventions by scientists. Technology has spread all over the world and people use it all the time. 
              It is no longer limited to work and in developed societies, but any person, regardless of his or her cultural or social level, or whatever his age, can use a cell phone, for example, to take pictures, send and receive them. 
              Technology helps us to keep in touch with people who are away from us. We use phones and computers to talk to them and even see them. 
              Our daily work office is also technology-based. People no longer use pen and paper to complete their work. You can edit a pdf online to customize documents your way with easy-to-use editing tools.<br><br><br>
              
              We keep our health by going to the gyms. There are machines in the gym that help us reduce our weight and keep fit. We get to keep a lot of information in a small device and use it when we like. Cars have also become better with the use of technology. 
              Technology can not be appropriate for some tasks and has negative influences. Everyone determines and decides how to use this technology in a negative or positive way.<br><br><br>
              The same technology can be used by two people in different ways.
              
              Importance of Technology in Communication:-<br><br>
               Technological advances in communication have become endless. Technology is of great importance in terms of facilitating communication between people, as it has contributed effectively to making the big world look like a small village. 
              This has been achieved with technology that provides opportunities for people to promote and facilitate communication between them, ranging from fixed and mobile phones to the Internet and the related ability of people to communicate with each other across continents and countries in a matter of seconds. 
              Technology provides the possibility of communication between many parties in different regions of the world very quickly, which helps them to spread, both in the dissemination of information and various news or in the sharing of knowledge and science.<br><br><br>
              
              Modern Technology and the World Wide Web:-<br><br>
              The World Wide Web is defined as all content on the Internet such as web pages, videos, and images that are displayed in HTML and can be accessed through the user's web browser.
              
              It should be noted that the Web is symbolized by the abbreviation (WWW), and access to this network through a communication protocol known as (HTTP), this network was invented by Tim Berners-Lee in 1991. 
              After the invention of the Web, and when it became accessible to all people, its pages were filled with millions of sites that serve people in their lives by providing information and knowledge and allowing people to communicate with each other through programs that allow seeing the caller still and moving pictures.<br><br>
              
              Importance of Technology in Education:-<br><br>
              Technology contributes significantly to the access and acquisition of information, and thus the development. This is the reason for the existence of a huge scientific and cognitive revolution, which entails facilitating human life by increasing inventions in various practical fields.
              
              E-learning is one of the most significant contributions of technology to learning; The learner can control his / her education system by managing the learning process, the content of the learning process, and communicating with colleagues during the learning process.
              
              E-learning has provided the learner with many programs that provide immediate reference to what the learner is asking for, by providing discussion forums and libraries that allow questions to be asked and answered very quickly. 
              Technological advances have also allowed the so-called open education that allows people with health problems or living far away to enroll in online classrooms.
              
              You can transform your learning style with online education resources. PDF is a file format developed by Adobe to present documents. Using online tools, you can edit pdf for free. PDF software makes it possible to convert existing materials and create new resources in a digital format.<br><br>
              
              Importance of Technology In Decision-Making and Problem-Solving:-<br><br>
              Technology has contributed to solving various human problems, especially at the present time due to the rapid state of change associated with the amount of information that exists. 
              It has also facilitated communication between human beings and has helped to provide different means of transport and introduced new agricultural methods that are a reason for increasing food production.
              
              It should be noted that applications made in the field of health care and consequently positive, and many other technological means have developed the lives of people, and helped them save time and effort.  
              For example, technology supplies factories with many advanced machines and equipment that have helped to provide high-quality goods and services, facilitate production processes in factories, and make them less time and effort-consuming, in addition to reducing the cost of operating for the benefit of employers.<br><br><br>
              
              Importance of Technology in Domestic Work:-<br><br>
              Electric power provides light to people's homes and roads; it is used to power electrical tools, factories, etc. 
              There are many modern tools that made it easier for people, such as the vacuum cleaner, which was replaced by old tools used to do so, as well as the electric heating device for various foods called (microwave), and the ordinary oven. 
              Microwaves became popular in the late ‚Äô70s. It simplified the process of heating pre-cooked food. Also, while heating food, they are less prone to spread pollution when compared to regular gas stoves. That suits sustainable living, too!
              Electricity has made it easier for the housewife to prepare food easily and quickly and many other modern tools that are truly a blessing from God to modern man.<br><br><br>
              
              Importance of Technology in Health Care:-<br><br>
              Technology has helped doctors answer all patient queries faster. There are various technological innovations in the health sector, such as the invention of certain drugs, the development of information technology, biotechnology, and development processes. 
              Technology constantly strives to contribute to the development of instruments and equipment used in the medical field and preserve the healthy lives of people and raise their standard of care. 
              This has led to the development of some inventions to become larger and more useful and complex in installation, such as detectors and magnetic resonance imaging, and industrial devices with an automated system.
              
              Advanced medical devices have made it possible to detect many diseases and have facilitated their treatment. In addition, they have provided the opportunity to complete some types of treatment at home, resulting in a shorter stay in hospitals, and thus a reduction in the cost of treatment.<br><br>
              
              Importance of Technology in Business Today:-<br><br>
              Business is one of the most beneficial areas of technology. The manager makes his decisions in a short time and he can easily solve problems, with the help of technology.
              
              Information technology and its applications in the business world have facilitated the use of computers and allowed the use of the Web, thus making work more flexible.  The most important advantages of technology in this area may include:<br><br>
              
              Easy access to reports: There are many companies that have many branches locally or globally. 
              Technology allows them to communicate between their multiple branches to obtain reports on the progress of the work and financial capabilities of each branch, and it provides an opportunity to connect to competing markets and provide reports that are available. 
              Thus, technology can be relied on to carry out these tasks rather than sending delegates and reviewers for information.<br><br><br>
              
              Technology is a set of programs: Computer programming is one of the most important aspects of modern life. Modern technology such as smart TVs, calculators, traffic lights, and cars use internal coding systems. Programming languages allow humans to communicate with these devices. Computer programmers can help with programming homework. Learning the basics of programming can set you apart from your counterparts and give you a competitive edge in this technology-driven era.
              
              Increased employee productivity: Technology has contributed to a significant increase in the productivity of workers, both at the level of clerical work or manufacturing work, as most industries are now using machines instead of the human element; This means saving time and effort. 
              Despite the high cost of using technology in the industrial field, its usefulness was greater than its cost; It saves the labor cost required in the production process, while at the business level related to customer service, it increases employee productivity so that all data and information are reviewed in a short time rather than manually.<br><br><br>
             
              
              The following points address some of the benefits and importance of using technology in business:-<br><br><br>
              
              ‚û£Technology provides many mechanisms that contribute to increasing the efficiency of work and productivity entrusted to it, in addition to accelerating and facilitating the work process.<br><br>
              
              ‚û£There are many software programs that help to achieve accuracy in financial transactions and related salaries of employees, or pay bills or other, and make the implementation of these tasks easier.<br><br>
              
              
              ‚û£The technology achieves a high degree of competition between companies or institutions and provides a number of mechanisms to help, including marketing and selling online, as well as communicating with the right customers in the right place and time.<br><br>
              
              ‚û£Technology facilitates communication between co-workers or even with customers and consumers.<br><br> </p>

            <h2>What is artificial intelligence?</h2>
            <h5>What is AI?, Jul 29, 2023</h5>
            </div>
            <p>Humans and machines:-<br><br> a match made in productivity heaven. Our species wouldn‚Äôt have gotten very far without our mechanized workhorses. From the wheel that revolutionized agriculture to the screw that held together increasingly complex construction projects to the robot-enabled assembly lines of today, machines have made life as we know it possible. And yet, despite their seemingly endless utility, humans have long feared machines‚Äîmore specifically, the possibility that machines might someday acquire human intelligence and strike out on their own.<br><br>

              But we tend to view the possibility of sentient machines with fascination as well as fear. This curiosity has helped turn science fiction into actual science. Twentieth-century theoreticians, like computer scientist and mathematician Alan Turing, envisioned a future where machines could perform functions faster than humans. The work of Turing and others soon made this a reality. Personal calculators became widely available in the 1970s, and by 2016, the US census showed that 89 percent of American households had a computer. Machines‚Äîsmart machines at that‚Äîare now just an ordinary part of our lives and culture.<br><br><br>
              
              Those smart machines are getting faster and more complex. Some computers have now crossed the exascale threshold, meaning that they can perform as many calculations in a single second as an individual could in 31,688,765,000 years. But it‚Äôs not just about computation. Computers and other devices are now acquiring skills and perception that have previously been our sole purview.
              
              AI is a machine‚Äôs ability to perform the cognitive functions we associate with human minds, such as perceiving, reasoning, learning, interacting with an environment, problem solving, and even exercising creativity. You‚Äôve probably interacted with AI even if you didn‚Äôt realize it‚Äîvoice assistants like Siri and Alexa are founded on AI technology, as are some customer service chatbots that pop up to help you navigate websites.</p>
